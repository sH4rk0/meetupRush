# meetupRush
A multiplayer rush game developed using the following technologies: [Phaser](http://phaser.io), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), 
[Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com)

## Why this game?
I'm a member of [“Javascript meetup Salerno”](https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/JS-Salerno/) and from the last month (09/2016) we have decided to award (randomly) 
one meetup partecipant, with a gift offered by our montly sponsor. 
Since the first lucky guy was chosen using a simple random function, 
i decided to find a more funny way to choose the winners of next meetups. 
This game was not made for commercial purpose, only for learning and sharing knowledge.
